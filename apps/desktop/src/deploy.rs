//! Where a workspace can be deployed, and how to send a pipeline there.
//!
//! Authoring happens on a laptop and running happens on a server, and until now nothing
//! joined the two: the desktop could commit and push, the server could not pull, so a
//! pipeline reached production by external CI, a cron, or somebody copying a file.
//!
//! A target is a named server plus a credential for it. The credential is an API key
//! minted by that server (`duckle-runner console key-add`), which is the right shape here:
//! it belongs to this machine rather than to a person, it carries its own role, and it can
//! be revoked centrally without touching anyone's account.
//!
//! The key is encrypted at rest with the workspace key, the same protection saved
//! connections get, and **it is never returned to the front end**. The UI needs to know
//! which targets exist, not what they are authenticated with, so listing returns names and
//! URLs only. A token that reaches the browser layer is a token in a log, a crash report
//! and a screenshot.
