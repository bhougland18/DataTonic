 * Sending the desktop shape would deploy a schedule the server quietly ignores, so it is
 * translated here rather than hoped over.
 *
 * A file watch has no expression that endpoint can store, so it is not sent at all.
 *
 * The zone and exclusion calendar go too. Sending only the trigger put a Brussels
 * 03:00 job on the server's clock, usually UTC, with its maintenance days
 * forgotten. A schedule without them sends neither key, which the server reads as
 * "leave what is there alone".
