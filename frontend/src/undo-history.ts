// document (covers node add/delete/move, edge changes, and component settings
// edits).

// History is captured by observing the active pipeline and recording the
// previous settled snapshot whenever a *meaningful* change lands. "Meaningful"
// excludes pure selection changes and run-preview data (schema / sampleRows),
// so selecting a node or running the pipeline never pollutes history; a burst of
// changes (e.g. a drag) is coalesced into one step via a short debounce.
//
// Kept free of React so it can be driven directly with a fake clock; the hook in
// useUndoRedo.ts only feeds it snapshots and applies what it returns.
