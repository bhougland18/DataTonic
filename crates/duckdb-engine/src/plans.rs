//! Plans: several pipelines, in an order somebody chose.
//!
//! A schedule runs one pipeline on a clock. A plan runs many, in steps: everything inside
//! a step goes at once, and the next step waits for the one before it to finish. That is
//! the shape most nightly loads already have, written down instead of being three schedules
//! set a few minutes apart and hoped over.
//!
//! The engine can already do this with `ctl.runpipeline` and `ctl.parallelize`, and a plan
//! could have compiled to those. It does not, for one reason: a compiled plan is a single
//! run, and what an operator wants when a nightly load fails at 3am is to see *which*
//! pipeline failed, in the run history, next to every other run. So a plan drives the
//! ordinary run path once per pipeline, and what it adds is the ordering and a record of
//! the whole attempt.
//!
//! Execution takes the runner as a closure. Deciding what runs next is the part worth
//! testing, and it should be testable without a DuckDB binary, a workspace or a clock.
